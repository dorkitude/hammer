Hammer

Hammer is built on two classes: *Hammer* and *Swing*
A Swing is just a thread that uses mechanize to open a connection to the URL passed in its constructor.
The Hammer spawns concurrent Swings.    

Use it like this:
        my_url = "http://nin.ja/urlThing"<br />
        Hammer(url=my_url, num_swings=100).run()
