<h3>Hammer</h3>
<p>
    Hammer is built on two classes: Hammer and Swing.
</p>
<p>
    A Swing is just a thread that uses mechanize to open a connection to the URL passed in its constructor.
    The Hammer spawns concurrent Swings.    
</p>    
<p>    
    Use it like this:
</p>
<p>
    <em>
        my_url = "http://nin.ja/urlThing"<br />
        Hammer(url=my_url, num_swings=100).run()
    </em>
