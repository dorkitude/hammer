Hammer!!!




What hammer is
    Hammer calls a URL many times concurrently, which is very useful for rudimentary load testing :)


Use it like this
        my_url = "http://nin.ja/urlThing"
        Hammer(url=my_url, num_swings=100).run()


How it works
    Hammer is built on two classes: *Hammer* and *Swing*, and it submodules mechanize.

    *Swing*
        is just a thread that uses mechanize to open a connection to the URL passed in its constructor
    *Hammer*
        spawns and starts concurrent Swings
    *mechanize*
        currently, I fork from jjlee @ http://github.com/jjlee/mechanize
